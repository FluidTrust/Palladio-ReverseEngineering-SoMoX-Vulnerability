This project implements a Eclipse Plug-In for static security code analysis. The results of the code analysis is done with the help of the [Snyk](https://snyk.io/) command line interface. Analysis results are annotated to the traced PCM entities. Therefore, a software security analysis is made possible without building a new security model.
The annotation is made possible by the [Palladio-Addon: ContextConfidentiality-Metamodel](https://github.com/FluidTrust/Palladio-Addons-ContextConfidentiality-Metamodel). For detailed security information the [Snyk vulnerability database](https://snyk.io/vuln) is used.

The project was implemented within the scope of the practical master course *Werkzeuge für Agile Modellierung* at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology.

## Technologies:
The project is built with:

* Eclipse (Version: 2021-03 (4.19.0))
* Java 11 (openjdk version 11.0.11)
* Maven (Version: 3.6.3)

Following dependencies exist:

* [jsoup](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.jsoup/jsoup)
* [Context Metamodel](https://github.com/FluidTrust/Palladio-Addons-ContextConfidentiality-Metamodel)

## Installation
For the installation and further development of plugins follow these steps:
1. Clone and import the *Palladio-ReverseEngineering-Docker-Vulnerability* repository 
    *git clone https://github.com/FluidTrust/Palladio-ReverseEngineering-Docker-Vulnerability.git*
    and checkout the branch **snyk_implementaiton** - Further development will be here
1. Download and install maven [download](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)
1. Change to the project directory and run *mvn clean install*. The build should be successful.

For launching plugins from Eclipse:
1. Download and install Eclipse [download](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/)
1. Download and install *Eclipse PDE (Plug-in Development Environment)*
    * Go to Eclipse &rarr; Help &rarr; Eclipse Marketplace
    * Search and install Eclipse PDE (Plug-in Development Environment)
1. Download and install the newes Palladio Plugin [download](https://sdqweb.ipd.kit.edu/wiki/PCM_Installation) 
1. Import the project from the maven_project directory together with the nested projetcs.
1. Clone and import the *ContextConfidentality Metamodel* repository 
*git clone https://github.com/FluidTrust/Palladio-Addons-ContextConfidentiality-Metamodel.git*

Now it should be possible to launch plugins.

## Functionalities
The plugin should be used as adaptor. Use the interface bundle to implement the interface and fill the parameters for analysis. The plugin will process the parameters and return a new PCM where the found security vulnerabilities are annotated.

## Tests

Since this projects connects multiple projects which are all well tested, there were only a few tests needed to test the parsers. These tests are well implemented and successful. 

To run the tests, a Snyk binary is required. Place it in the *bin/* directory.

## Further development

1. The functionalities should be integrated into the Palladio workflow
1. The Snyk CLI should be changed to the actual Snyk API. Therefore, website and CLI Parsing will no longer be needed.
1. Authentification should be integrated into the security analysis.
