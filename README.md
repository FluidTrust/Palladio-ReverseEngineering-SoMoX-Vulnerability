This project implements a Eclipse Plug-In for static security code analysis. The results of the code analysis is done with the help of the [Snyk](https://snyk.io/) command line interface. Analysis results are annotated to the traced PCM entities. Therefore, a software security analysis is made possible without building a new security model.
The annotation is made possible by the [Palladio-Addon: ContextConfidentiality-Metamodel](https://github.com/FluidTrust/Palladio-Addons-ContextConfidentiality-Metamodel). For detailed security information the [Snyk vulnerability database](https://snyk.io/vuln) is used.

The project was originally implemented within the scope of the practical master course *Werkzeuge f√ºr Agile Modellierung* at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology.
Since then, it has been maintained and improved upon.

## Technologies:
The project is built with:

* Eclipse (Version: 2022-12 (4.26.0))
* Java 17 (OpenJDK version 17.0.6)
* Maven (Version: 3.8.6)

Following dependencies exist:

* [jsoup](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.jsoup/jsoup)
* [Context Metamodel](https://github.com/FluidTrust/Palladio-Addons-ContextConfidentiality-Metamodel)
* [Rule Engine](https://github.com/PalladioSimulator/Palladio-ReverseEngineering-SoMoX-RuleEngine)

## Installation
For the installation and further development of plugins follow these steps:
1. Clone and import the *Palladio-ReverseEngineering-Docker-Vulnerability* repository 
    *git clone https://github.com/FluidTrust/Palladio-ReverseEngineering-Docker-Vulnerability.git*
1. Download and install maven [download](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)
1. Change to the project directory and run *mvn clean install*. The build should be successful.

For launching plugins from Eclipse:
1. Download and install Eclipse [download](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/)
1. Download and install *Eclipse PDE (Plug-in Development Environment)*
    * Go to Eclipse &rarr; Help &rarr; Eclipse Marketplace
    * Search and install Eclipse PDE (Plug-in Development Environment)
1. Download and install the newes Palladio Plugin [download](https://sdqweb.ipd.kit.edu/wiki/PCM_Installation) 
1. Import the project from the maven_project directory together with the nested projetcs.
1. Clone and import the *ContextConfidentality Metamodel* repository 
*git clone https://github.com/FluidTrust/Palladio-Addons-ContextConfidentiality-Metamodel.git*

Now it should be possible to launch plugins.

## Functionalities
The plugin should be used as adaptor. Use the interface bundle to implement the interface and fill the parameters for analysis. The plugin will process the parameters and return a new PCM where the found security vulnerabilities are annotated.

## Tests

Since this projects connects multiple projects which are all well tested, there were only a few tests needed to test the parsers. These tests are well implemented and successful. 

To run the tests, a Snyk binary is required. Place it in the *bin/* directory.

## Further development

* The Snyk CLI should be changed to the actual Snyk API. Therefore, website and CLI Parsing will no longer be needed.
